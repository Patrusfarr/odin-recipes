    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>
        Herein lies the recipe to create the most ooey gooey mac-n-cheese. The pasta and cheese are made from scratch to ensure no shenanigans have been added
        to our diet in order to mind control or poison us.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>3 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>.5 teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Mound the flour on a clean work surface or in a large bowl. Create a well in the center and add the eggs, salt, and olive oil (if using).</li>
        <li>Use a fork to gently whisk the wet ingredients, gradually incorporating flour from the inner walls of the well until a thick, shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Use your hands to bring the dough together and knead for 8 to 10 minutes until it is smooth, elastic, and springs back when pressed. </li>
        <li>Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap or cover it with a clean kitchen towel to prevent it from drying out.</li>
        <li>Let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax, making it easier to shape. </li>
        <li>Take a small piece of dough and roll it around a floured rod, applying gentle pressure to create a tube shape. Gently slide the noodle off the rod.</li>
        <li>Cut the long tubes into smaller, traditional elbow-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Place the shaped macaroni on a floured baking sheet, ensuring they are spread apart to dry slightly while you finish the rest of the dough.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a rolling boil (it should taste like the ocean). Do not add oil, as it prevents sauce from sticking.</li>
        <li>Add the fresh macaroni to the boiling water and stir gently to prevent sticking. Fresh pasta cooks quickly, typically in 2 to 4 minutes until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta (reserving some starchy pasta water for your sauce, if desired) and toss immediately with a cup of shredded cheddar cheese. </li>
    </ol>
