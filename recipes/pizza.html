    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>
        In this recipe, we are making a delicious pepperoni pizza. No pineapple or anchoves. Just a good old fashioned pizza that EVERYONE can enjoy 
        not just vegetarians. It's not delivery, it's not Dijorno, it's mother fuckin Papa Pat's hand-made, no extra bullshit, pizza.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>2.25 teaspoons Yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup Water </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>3 cups Bread Flour </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Activate the yeast: In a large bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. 
            Stir gently and let the mixture stand for about 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy and bubbly. 
            If it does not foam, the yeast may be expired, and you should start again with a new packet.
        </li>

        <li>
            Combine ingredients: Stir the olive oil and salt into the yeast mixture. 
            Gradually add the flour, a cup at a time, mixing until the dough starts to come together and pull away from the sides of the bowl.
        </li>

        <li>
            Knead the dough: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. 
            Knead it by hand for about 4-10 minutes, or use a stand mixer with a dough hook for 5-7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. 
            Add a little more flour if it is too sticky, or a little more water if it is too dry.
        </li>

        <li>
            First rise: Lightly brush a large, clean bowl with olive oil. 
            Place the dough ball in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides with oil. 
            Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. 
            Place it in a warm, draft-free place and let it rise until it has doubled in size, which typically takes 1 to 1.5 hours.
        </li>

        <li>
            Shape and bake: Once the dough has risen, punch it down gently to release the air. 
            Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into two equal balls (for two medium pizzas). 
            Let the dough rest for another 10 minutes, then roll or stretch it to your desired size and thickness.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add toppings and bake: Transfer the shaped dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet or a preheated pizza stone. 
            Add pepperoni generously. Bake in a preheated oven (typically 450-500°F or 230-260°C) for about 12-15 minutes, 
            until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. 
        </li>
    </ol>
